# Decision Logs (ODS)

**Related script:** [`02_exploratory_data_analysis`](../sql/scripts/02_exploratory_data_analysis.sql)

**Doc Scope:** Defines the intent, ownership, and stopping criteria for the project’s EDA phase. The goal is to keep analysis decision-driven and scoped to business choices rather than exhaustive exploration.

The blueprint is used to:
- Translate broad analytical questions into concrete decision boundaries
- Prevent unnecessary depth and analysis paralysis
- Make stopping conditions explicit once decisions are sufficiently supported

**Decision Owner Note:** The “Decision Owner” field indicates the assumed accountable function and may be updated if ownership differs in practice.


| Analysis Focus | Decision Owner | Decision (What we rule out) | Stop Rule (Exit Criteria) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Market Demand Concentration | Investment Strategy | Rule out equal weighting of markets for 2015 growth spend | Stop once remaining insights can’t shift budget or direction |
| Product Demand & Mix | Merch Budget Allocation | Rule out using product-level revenue or demand concentration as a safe allocation rule | Stop once remaining insights can’t shift budget or direction |
| Pricing & Discount Sensitivity | Growth Budget Governance | Rule out aggressive discounting as a primary allocation path | Stop once remaining insights can’t shift budget or direction |
| Fulfillment Cost Impact | Cost Governance | Rule out fulfillment speed as a universal growth allocation | Stop once remaining insights can’t shift budget or direction |
| Segment Contribution & Demand Quality | Growth Budget Allocation | Rule out segment-led spend when contribution scale, organic demand, or persistence fail to justify allocation | Stop when remaining insights can no longer influence budget or strategic decisions |
