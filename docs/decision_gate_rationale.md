# Decision Gate Rationale

**Purpose:** Defines the decision gates used to assess whether an incremental $3M growth budget can be deployed under a risk managed mandate.

## Decision Mandate

This analysis prioritizes long term demand integrity over short term revenue acceleration. <br>
Findings and recommendations are evaluated within this mandate.

## Gate Overview

- Market eligibility and absorption capacity
- Allocation boundaries below the market level
- Growth lever dependency and persistence


## Gate Rationale

### Gate: Market Eligibility and Absorption Capacity

**Narrative under test** <br>
Every active market contributes meaningfully to growth, so incremental budget should be distributed broadly.

**Why this narrative is risky** <br>
Broad distribution assumes demand scales with coverage. When false, incremental spend produces dilution rather than growth.

**Falsification logic** <br>
Rejected when markets lack sufficient demand scale or fail to demonstrate stable revenue and demand trends over time.

**What passing does not imply** <br>
Passing does not indicate optimal allocation within a market or immunity to future volatility.

### Gate: Allocation Boundaries Below the Market Level

**Narrative under test** <br>
Product categories or customer segments provide safe signals for concentrating incremental investment.

**Why this narrative is risky** <br>
Sub market allocation amplifies volatility and incentive dependency when demand signals are unstable or artificially sustained.

**Falsification logic** <br>
Rejected when category or segment signals are conflicting, non dominant, volatile, or dependent on incentives rather than organic demand.

**What passing does not imply** <br>
Passing would not imply guaranteed efficiency or superior ROI. It would only indicate eligibility under a risk managed mandate.

### Gate: Growth Lever Dependency and Persistence

**Narrative under test** <br>
Incentives or operational levers reliably explain market scale and can be used to guide incremental investment.

**Why this narrative is risky** <br>
Short term uplift can masquerade as demand, creating artificial scale that collapses under reduced incentives or cost pressure.

**Falsification logic** <br>
Rejected when uplift fails to persist without incentives, does not scale consistently, or does not increase willingness to pay.

**What passing does not imply** <br>
Passing does not imply universal effectiveness or permanent leverage across markets.
