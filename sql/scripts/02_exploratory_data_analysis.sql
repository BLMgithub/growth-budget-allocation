    Problem Constrained EDA:
    Decision scoped analysis used to eliminate signals,
    not discover new problem directions.

    Purpose:
    - Apply demand and viability checks for budget allocation
    - Surface decision-relevant candidate signals that can move the decision
    - Kill narratives that don’t scale or rely on incentives
    - Produce inputs for synthesis, not conclusions
